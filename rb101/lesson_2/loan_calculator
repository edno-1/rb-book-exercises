Inputs required:
- the loan amount: p
- the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) -> monthly interest rate, j
- the loan duration -> loan duration in months, n

The loan amount doesn't change need to be converted.
The APR needs to be converted from an annual interest rate to a monthly interest rate, j
The loan duration, if given in years, should be converted to months, n

Formula is as follows:

m = p * (j / (1 - (1 + j)**(-n)))

*use explicit variable names instead of single-letter variables to make the code more readable.

Outputs expected:
Given the inputs above, solve for m. Before we solve for m, we need to convert APR and loan duration to j and n.

j - monthly interest rate
n - loan duration in months
m - monthly payment


Based on the above, the program may flow as follows:
User inputs a loan amount, an APR, and a loan duration.
- Loan amount should be able to take integers as well as floats to account for cents.
- The APR should be able to take an integer and float % value - ex. 5% or 5.5%
- Loan duration - take an integer value and then ask user to clarify if value was in years or months
(aka make sure the user enters a valid number, else return an error and repropmt the user)
*question - is it possible to control the number of digits entered after the decimal in a float? - probably yes - then how?

Psuedocode
START
# Given three values - loan amount, APR, and loan duration
SET loan_amount = user inputted loan amount
SET apr = user inputted APR
SET loan_duration = user inputted loan duration
END

Prompt the user for these values separately and at each point, verify the validity of the values entered. If the entered value is valid, convert it into usable form
Loan amount
- if the user enters nothing or a non-num character, we should return an error message and prompt again.
- if possible, limit to two digits after the decimal point if user enters number with decimal values.
- otherwise, keep as is and save to value.

APR
- if the user enters nothing or a non-num character, we should return an error message and prompt again.
- save the APR value
- convert APR % into decimal by dividing by 100
- convert to monthly interest rate by dividing the decimal APR number by 12 - save the return value

Loan duration
- if the user enters nothing or a non-num character, we should return an error message and prompt again.
- once the user enters a valid integer, prompt the user to choose year(s) or month(s)
- if year(s), multiply by 12 for the number of months and save the value
- if month(s), save the value directly

After going through all of these processing steps, we can pass the saved values into the provided fomula.
The return should be the monthly payment.
